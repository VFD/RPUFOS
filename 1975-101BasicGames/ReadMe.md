## Introduction

To do.



Most of these programs were included in the 1978 edition.

Column "I" mean:
* ✅ Included     - direct link to the 1978 edition.
* ❎ Not included - linked to the 101 directory.

The 1978 versions are more accurate.\
It is possible either to retrieve the original source code or to rewrite it based on the 1978 codebase and later versions.

Need to change table.
